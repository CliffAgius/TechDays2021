# TechDays2021

Join us on Monday 15th November at 10:00 GMT for an exciting Tech Days event all about IoT.

Each of our Tech Days events incorporates a series of sessions on a technical topic, interspersed with guests from the technical community.

In our next Tech Days event, hosts Clifford Agius and Pete Gallagher – both Microsoft MVPs – will bring you ‘A flight into IoT’.

# What to expect.

Interested in building an end-to-end IoT solution or learning about Azure IoT, but aren't quite sure how to get started? Cliff and Pete will take you through an end-to-end solution from real flight tracking data like speed, altitude and location from a flight departing London. During the event we’ll track the flight’s progress to its destination and show how to get that data from an IoT device at the edge into Microsoft Azure IoT and the cloud where it can be processed for display on a dashboard or stored for later processing. We won’t be able to teach you how to become an IoT expert in the 2.5 hours we have – but what we can do is show you how to build on your current developer skills to integrate IoT into your business applications (and passion projects!) and set you up on your journey to become certified in IoT with the Microsoft AZ220 qualification.

# Agenda:

    10.00	Welcome to the show
    10.05	Follow Pete and Cliff as they take a Raspberry Pi simulated 
            device, connect it to the IoT Hub and walk through the set-up of the device within IoT Hub.
    10:25am	Q&A
    10:35am	Pete and Cliff will introduce you to NanoFramework with 
            Microsoft Visual Studio and code in DotNet C# controlling a real Esp32 device connecting real sensor data back to the IoT Hub created in the first session.
    10:55am	Q&A
    11:05am	In this session the IoT Hub routes the live data to send a 
            tweet based on sensor data from the device, showing where the flight is in real time.
    11:25am	Q&A
    11:35am	BREAK
    11:40am	Pete and Cliff explore Time Series Insights and the power 
            and tools available to take data, understand how that data can support business objectives and how to store and display that data. 
    12:00 pm	Q&A
    12:10pm	Pete and Cliff take live data from the device and display 
            it using Microsoft Power BI dashboard, showing a map of the flight’s progress, including altitude, heading, speed etc and showing how that data supports business needs.
    12:30pm	Q&A
    12:40pm	Wrap up and next steps
    12:45pm	Session Close
