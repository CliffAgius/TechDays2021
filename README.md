# TechDays2021

Join us on Monday 15th November at 10:00 GMT for an exciting Tech Days event all about IoT.

Each of our Tech Days events incorporates a series of sessions on a technical topic, interspersed with guests from the technical community.

In our next Tech Days event, hosts Clifford Agius and Pete Gallagher – both Microsoft MVPs – will bring you ‘A flight into IoT’.

# What to expect.

Interested in building an end-to-end IoT solution or learning about Azure IoT, but aren't quite sure how to get started? Cliff and Pete will take you through an end-to-end solution from real flight tracking data like speed, altitude and location from a flight departing London. During the event we’ll track the flight’s progress to its destination and show how to get that data from an IoT device at the edge into Microsoft Azure IoT and the cloud where it can be processed for display on a dashboard or stored for later processing. We won’t be able to teach you how to become an IoT expert in the 2.5 hours we have – but what we can do is show you how to build on your current developer skills to integrate IoT into your business applications (and passion projects!) and set you up on your journey to become certified in IoT with the Microsoft AZ220 qualification.

# Agenda:

| Time | Speaker | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 10.00 |     |	Welcome to the show |
| 10.05	| Pete & Cliff | Pete and Cliff kick off the show by introducing the overall IoT solution, the moving parts and how they connect together to form the end product. |
| 10:15am | Pete | Pete explains how, although a physical device will be used to drive the data, it’s also possible to use a free online Azure Raspberry Pi Simulator as way to get data flowing into Azure.|
| 10:25am |    | Q&A |
| 10:35am | Cliff and Jose | Cliff and Jose will introduce you to .NET nanoFramework with Microsoft Visual Studio and code written in .NET C# to control a real ESP32 device. The ESP32 will send flight sensor data to an Azure IoT Hub and onwards to the rest of the solution. |
| 10:55am |    | Q&A |
| 11:05am | Maria-Anastasia | In this session Maria-Anastasia will show how to configure the IoT Hub to route live “out of bounds” data to a Service Bus and on to a Logic App, to send notifications to services like Twitter or Microsoft Teams. |
| 11:25am |     | Q&A |
| 11:35am |     | BREAK |
| 11:40am | Sander | Sander shows the power of Time Series Insights to capture data, understand how that data can support business objectives and how to surface that data from an engineer’s perspective. |
| 12:00pm |     | Q&A |
| 12:10pm | John | John shows the finished product, taking live data from the device and displaying it using a Microsoft Power BI dashboard. The dashboard shows a map of the flight’s progress, including altitude, heading, speed etc and showing how that data supports business needs. |
| 12:30pm |      | Q&A |
| 12:40pm |      | Wrap up and next steps |
| 12:45pm |      | Session Close |
